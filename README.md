# ðŸš— Driver Fatigue Monitoring System

A deep learningâ€“based system that detects driver drowsiness in real-time using computer vision techniques.  
This project leverages **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Machine Learning** to analyze facial landmarks and eye aspect ratio to predict fatigue and alert the driver.

##  Overview

Driver fatigue is a leading cause of road accidents. This system monitors the driver's face via a webcam feed and detects signs of fatigue such as:
- Eye closure for a prolonged period
- Yawning
- Head tilt or nodding

Once fatigue is detected, the system triggers an **alert sound** to wake up the driver.
